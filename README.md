# cfNDA_celltype
Analysis of originating cell type composition based on Nanopore cfDNA methylome
The main function is in the housman_test_cfDNA.R file. It is based on the publication of Houseman et al.:

Houseman, E.A., Accomando, W.P., Koestler, D.C. et al.
DNA methylation arrays as surrogate measures of cell mixture distribution.
BMC Bioinformatics 13, 86 (2012). https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-13-86

An example use is shown in the data_analysis reproduce.R, which shows how to use it with a set of cfDNA data.
